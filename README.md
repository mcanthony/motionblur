# Motionblur

Motion Blur shader for Goo Create, based on this article: http://john-chapman-graphics.blogspot.se/2013/01/what-is-motion-blur-motion-pictures-are.html

The motion blur is a script. add it anywhere in the scene to turn on the effect.

Here's the public Goo Create scene: https://create.goocreate.com/edit/474b80717f5c4e679781936c4b0fbeff.scene

## Caveats

The effect does not seem to work for skyboxes. Get around this by making a skybox manually (create a big cube or sphere).
